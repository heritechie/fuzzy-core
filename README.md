# fuzzy-core

`fuzzy-core` is a **spec-first fuzzy string similarity core** designed as a low-level building block
for higher-level systems such as domain-aware resolvers.

## Scope

- String normalization
- Fuzzy similarity scoring
- Deterministic and language-agnostic behavior

## Non-goals

- No datasets
- No domain-specific logic
- No entity resolution

## Architecture

- Specification-first
- Rust as reference implementation
- Python bindings via FFI
- Other languages may reimplement the spec

## Status

🚧 Early development (v0.1 in progress)
